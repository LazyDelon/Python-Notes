# [**Eclipse Paho™ MQTT Python Client**](https://eclipse.dev/paho/files/paho.mqtt.python/html/index.html)   

## 📋 Overview

**The full documentation is available here.

Warning breaking change - Release 2.0 contains a breaking change; see the [**release notes**](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python/releases/tag/v2.0.0) and [**migration details**](
https://eclipse.dev/paho/files/paho.mqtt.python/html/migrations.html) .

This document describes the source code for the Eclipse Paho MQTT Python client library, which implements versions 5.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1 of the MQTT protocol.

This code provides a client class which enables applications to connect to an [**MQTT**](
https://mqtt.org/) broker to publish messages, and to subscribe to topics and receive published messages. It also provides some helper functions to make publishing one off messages to an MQTT server very straightforward.

It supports Python 3.7+.

The MQTT protocol is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/”Internet of Things” connectivity protocol. Designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport, it is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

Paho is an Eclipse Foundation project.**
